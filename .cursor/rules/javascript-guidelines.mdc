# JavaScript Guidelines

## Architecture
- Use ES6+ classes for organizing functionality
- Implement modular approach with separate classes for different features
- Use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries)
- Follow modern JavaScript best practices

## Key Classes
- `DarkModeToggle` - Handles theme switching and persistence
- `ScrollAnimations` - Manages intersection observer and smooth scrolling
- `Analytics` - Tracks user interactions (optional)

## Dark Mode Features
- Detect system preference on initial load
- Store user preference in localStorage
- Listen for system theme changes
- Provide smooth toggle animations
- Update accessibility attributes

## Animation System
- Use Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations
- Implement smooth scroll behavior for internal links
- Add subtle loading animations
- Use CSS transforms for performance

## Easter Eggs
- Include Konami code functionality
- Add rainbow animation effect
- Keep easter eggs subtle and fun

## Performance
- Use event delegation where possible
- Debounce scroll events if needed
- Minimize DOM queries
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
